  <p>I realised that I'm actually crap at art.
    That I would be a terrible artist because I'm not willing to give my soul and life to making art.
    That communicating to others is not my strong point and anything less than profound is not worth much.
    What really came from this experience is a love of art history as you delve into the experience and emotion of others
    and how they hated life too. That when you get past the anger of hurt and neglet you find that you miss the anger
    because you are ovewhelmed with the sense of nothingness. You have no anger to sper on a fight or energy to try.
    Life is but a void of nothingness. I have built up my barriers, created a fortress around myself and I don't want to open the gates.
    I just dont have the enrgey to fight this battle so the gate stays up and arrows fly from my castle as I fall deeper into the keep.
